# Alzheimer's Disease Prediction
Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia. Doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day functioning and the behavior associated with each type. Doctors can determine if a person has dementia with a high level of certainty. But it’s hard to determine the exact type of dementia because the symptoms and brain changes of different dementias can overlap. Moreover, there isn't any particular test that can confirm Dementia.

But, there are certain other parameters using which we can predict it. In this project, I try to analyze a few of the parameters that cause Dementia/Alzheimer's using an open source data set and build a classification model to predict it for individuals.
